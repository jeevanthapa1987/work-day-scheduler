##Work Day Scheduler:
Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app designed to help you schedule your work day efficiently. This application allows you
 to create a schedule, save your events, and view them later.

##Features:
Current Day Display: The current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar.
Time Blocks: Time blocks for standard business hours are provided, allowing you to schedule events throughout the day.
Color-Coded Blocks: Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, providing visual cues for your schedule.
